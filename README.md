# Refreshing_Highchart

## Rationale
-I want to visualize the gap in value between between once in a lifetime event items and effective equipment on the player marketplace in the game Runescape. -I want to demonstrate the link between my recreational interests and my desired career path.

## Workflow
-I will be using an API to pull the prices of various items on the Grand Exchange and convert them into files readable for Highcharts.js and set a time interval for 3-5 days.
-Ideally, the charts will be hostable in an iframe on my portfolio website.
